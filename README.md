# Cassiopee project

## Visualizing Dynamic Properties of the ETOILE Building using Web Technologies

A cassiopée project made at Telecom SudParis by Jul SQL, Sarah Zakon, Inès Kacer and Iris Marjollet

## Goal

Create a 2D and 3D visualization of the Étoile building from mesures and see them in a Flutter visualization.
The project is made of two parts: the creation of JSON files using the floor plans of the Etoile Building and the creation of a web application using Flutter.

## Using the application

To use the application and see the project, run the file [/flutter/app_Etoile_building/lib/main.dart](/flutter/app_Etoile_building/lib/main.dart)
To see the different 2D and 3D representations of the floors of the Etoile Building, use the menu and select a page
